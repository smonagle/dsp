[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth) , CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb)

**Output: (0.028879044654449883, -0.088672927072602)**

*The Cohen Effect Size between first babies and others is -0.089, indiciating other babies are 0.089 standard deviations heavier than firsts. 0.089 standard deviations is a very small difference indicating there is minimal difference in the weights of first-born babies and others. The Cohen's d for preganancy length was 0.029 standard deviations, which means first-time preganancies are slightly longer than others, but very minimally so.*
